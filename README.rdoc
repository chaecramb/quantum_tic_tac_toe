# Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe

An implementation of [Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tic-tac-toe) writen in 2 days as an extension of my project at CodeClan. I was pleased with the result, as it was a fairly ambitous for the time frame and stage of the course, but as result but having been written in such a short space of time it's in need of some refactoring (I'm tempted to re-write in Python).

My initial Tic-Tac-Toe app had multiple AI "personalities". The algorithm I used for it [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) won't work efficiently for QTTT however due having significantly more permutations of the game board. A QTTT AI is on the to-do list as it would involve some interesting data structure and algorithm problems.
